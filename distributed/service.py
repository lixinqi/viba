"""One service process of a distributed viba program: its api, and the store it shares.

A distributed program is one viba file whose steps are calls no single service
implements: each service has its own api, and a run stops at the first call that is
not its own, answering the deferral (`NotMyDutyException`) instead — which names the
storage path (`$step`) and the argument (`$call`). The scheduler writes that into the
store the services share as viba code: a file with one definition, `value`, holding
`$call` (the argument the step was given) and `$measured` (the result, `nil` until it
is filled in), written under the storage path the run stopped at
(`<storage path>/prepare/<api>.viba`, the api it asks for being the file name).
Anyone whose capability table has `<api>` can take the step from there and fill the
result in; the next round a run that stopped at that storage path finds it in the
store and goes on. Re-running is continuing.

`Service` is one process's side of that:

- `get_func` is the capability table the interpreter sees. A call of this service's
  api is served by its own implementation — every implementation goes through
  `recorded`, which is `replayed`: the first run computes the result and records it,
  every later run replays it. A call of another service's api is served from the
  store when the store already holds that call's result (that is how a run passes a
  step it cannot compute); with nothing stored the result is None, and the run stops
  with the deferral.
- `answer_pending` is the other half: what the store holds under this service's api
  names is computed now — the implementation handed the call's arguments the way a
  run hands them (`_the_computation`) — so that the next round's runs find it.
- `run_program` runs the program once and reports what came out.

The report is one JSON line on stdout — the scheduler reads it. A run that stopped
reports the failure state of the round as the viba source of the work order
(`$call $the_call * $measured nil`), which the scheduler writes at the storage path
the run stopped at: that is what the next round answers.
