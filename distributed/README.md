# distributed

Run one viba program on several services and one store. The package holds no program
and no api of its own — the caller brings both:

| Module | What it is |
|---|---|
| `service.py` | One service process's side: its api, the store it shares, the calls it answers, and the JSON report it prints |
| `scheduler.py` | The rounds over the services: the two phases, the failure state in the store, the outcome |

[`viba-distributed.md`](../viba-distributed.md) is the chapter over both;
[`demo/distributed/`](../demo/distributed/) holds three worked examples: two services in
[`naive/`](../demo/distributed/naive/), three in [`delivery/`](../demo/distributed/delivery/),
and five — one operation each — in [`reading/`](../demo/distributed/reading/).

## Run it

```bash
python3 -m distributed.scheduler --store <directory> --program <file> \
    --service <name>=<module> --service <name>=<module>
```

`--service NAME=MODULE` says two things: `NAME` is what the reports and the round record
call that service, and `MODULE` is a python module whose `__main__` runs
`distributed.service.run_service` with that service's api. One `--service` per service,
as many as the program has — the names and the modules are the caller's, and the scheduler
knows nothing about them beyond how to start them. Run it where `MODULE` is importable.

A command that runs a real program, with the names and modules filled in, is in each
demo's own README: [`naive/README.md`](../demo/distributed/naive/README.md) for two
services, [`delivery/README.md`](../demo/distributed/delivery/README.md) for three,
[`reading/README.md`](../demo/distributed/reading/README.md) for five.

The scheduler prints one JSON line per round and one line for the outcome:

```json
{"outcome": "ok", "rounds": 2, "service": "b", "value": 165}
```

The exit code is 0 for a schedule that reached `ok`, 1 for one that did not
(`stuck` — the program did not move; `unfinished` — the round cap; `broken` — a service
crashed or a step's implementation failed). `--rounds` (default 1024) is the cap.

## A service process

One service is one process, started by the scheduler twice per round:

```bash
python3 -m some.package.service_a --store /tmp/store --phase answer|run \
    --program path/to/program.viba
```

- `--phase answer`: compute what the store holds under this service's api names — what an
  earlier round left behind;
- `--phase run`: run the program once.

Either way the process prints one JSON line, which is its report:

```json
{"service": "a", "phase": "run", "result": "not_my_duty", "path": "root/c1",
 "func_name": "b_step", "reason": "no implementation", "api": [],
 "prepare": "value =\n  $call 9\n  * $measured nil\n"}
```

A module serves a service by naming its api — a function from a `Service` to
`{func_name: implementation}`, where an implementation takes the environment and one value
per argument of the call (`(environ, x)`, `(environ, x, y)`, …) and answers one result.
`demo/distributed/naive/service_a.py` is one, in full:

```python
def the_api(service):
    def a_step(environ, x):
        return service.recorded(environ, lambda: int(x.value) + random.randrange(1, 10))

    return {"a_step": a_step}


def main(argv=None) -> int:
    return run_service("a", the_api, argv)
```

A work order keeps those arguments as one viba data: the argument itself for a call with
one (`$call 9`), a tagged product for a call with several (`$call($x 9 * $y 4)`). So a
service that fills one in hands the arguments over again by the implementation's own
signature — `arguments_taken` reads it, and `the_arguments` splits the product apart in
written order. A call that was given a host value beside the environment cannot be answered
from a work order at all: that is reported as an error rather than handed over one argument
short.

## The round

Every round starts every service at once, twice: the **answer** phase first, then the
**run** phase. The order cannot be swapped — with a call still owed in the store, the
run stops at the same storage path a second time.

A round that ends with a deferral leaves its failure state in the store in two places:
viba code under the call's storage path (`<storage path>/prepare/<api>.viba`), and the
round as a record, `failure/round-<k>.viba`, naming where each service stopped and where
its file is.

## What the store holds

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `<storage path>/prepare/<api>.viba` | viba code (`$call` fixed, `$measured` still to come) under the call's storage path |
| `<storage path>/value.viba` | The result of that call — what `replayed` reads and writes, and what a replay reads |
| `failure/round-<k>.viba` | That round's failure state: which service stopped where, and where the first file is |

A run that reaches a step its host has no implementation for does not fail: it stops
with the **deferral** — `$not_my_duty_exception Duty`, one of the four branches of an
`interpret` result ([`viba-interpreter.md`](../viba-interpreter.md) writes all four out):

```viba
Duty =
    Object
  * $step Step        # which step it stopped at
  * $call ...         # what that step was given: the instance, as it was written
  * $reason str       # why it stopped

Step =
    Object
  * $module_path str  # where the run stopped: the storage path of the environment the call was given
  * $func_name str    # the name the step asks for
```

- `$step.module_path` is the call's **storage path** — the path of the child environment
  the call was given (`root/c1` here); `$step.func_name` is the name it asks for
  (`b_step` here), the one this process has no implementation for.
- `$call` is what the step was **given**: the arguments as they were written, evaluated
  by the time the run got there (`$call 9`). The environment comes first among the
  parameters and is a host value, not serializable data, so it does not travel — the side
  that takes the step makes its own.
- `$reason` is **why it stopped**: `no implementation` here.

The scheduler writes those three fields into the store. What is written has only two
parts, and neither works without the other:

- **viba code**: the file's content — one definition, `value`, with two members: `$call`
  (the argument this step was given, already fixed) and `$measured` (the result, `nil`
  until someone computes it);
- **the storage path**: where it is written — the path the run stopped at, with the api it
  asks for as the file name.

```viba
# <storage path>/prepare/<api>.viba
value =
  $call 9          # the argument this step was given
  * $measured nil  # the result, not computed yet
```

Each part carries half, so four things have their place:

| What you want to know | Where it is |
|---|---|
| which step | the storage path: the `<storage path>` piece (the `$step.module_path`) |
| which api | the storage path: the file name `<api>` (the `$step.func_name`) |
| what it was given | the viba code: `$call` (already a value) |
| what is still missing | the viba code: the nil `$measured` |

Those two parts together are the **viba work order**, and what makes it one rather than a
note that something failed is that it is self-contained and written under its own path: so
whoever has `<api>` in its capability table can take it, compute the result from `$call`,
and write it back — without knowing anything else about the run. No execution state
travels; the file in the store is the whole of it. A service fills it in through
`measure`, which records the result in `$measured` (and `replayed` records it at
`<storage path>/value.viba`).

Both services read and write one store at the same time, so a snapshot is written whole
or not at all (it is written beside the path and renamed onto it — see
[`viba-interpreter.md`](../viba-interpreter.md), the chapter on snapshots and replay).
What a reader gets is either nothing yet or one complete file, never half of one.

## The handles

| Name | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Service` (`service.py`) | One process's side: the api table, the shared store, `get_func` (the capability table), `answer_pending` (fill in what this service owes), `run_program` (run the program once and report it) |
| `Service.recorded` | What an implementation goes through: `replayed` — compute the result once, record it, replay it from then on |
| `Service.get_func` | A call of this service's api goes to its own implementation; a call of another service's api is replayed from the store when the store already holds that call's result; with neither the result is `None`, and the run stops with the deferral |
| `Service.pending` | The work orders under this service's api names that have no measurement yet |
| `run_service(name, api, argv)` | One service process's `__main__`: `--store`, `--phase answer\|run`, `--program` |
| `environ_at(module_path, store, ...)` | An environment at a store path — what a tool reads the store through |
| `distributed.scheduler.main` | The schedule: the rounds, filling in what is owed and running the program, the failure state, `--rounds` (default 1024) |
| `python3 -m distributed.scheduler --store <dir> --program <file> --service <name>=<module>` | Run one schedule; one JSON line per round on stdout, the last one the outcome |

## Where it is tested

`tests/test_distributed_service.py` covers this module's own side: how many arguments an
implementation takes, how a work order's `$call` is split back into them, and a whole
schedule in which a call with two arguments is answered from its work order. The demos'
tests (`demo/distributed/*/test_*.py`) cover whole schedules, each with its own program and
its own services.
