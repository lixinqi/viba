"""The scheduler: rounds over the services of one distributed viba program.

Every round starts every service process at once, twice:

- the **answer** phase: each service fills in what the round before left for it (a
  stopped run leaves viba code under the call's storage path,
  `<storage path>/prepare/<api>.viba` — `service.py` says what is in it), so that
  every run of the next phase starts from the same store;
- the **run** phase: each service runs the distributed program once and reports what
  came out.

A round that ends with a deferral is saved — this round's failure state — into the
store the rounds share: the deferral itself as viba code at the storage path the run
stopped at (`<storage path>/prepare/<api>.viba`), and the round as a record
(`failure/round-<k>.viba`). The next round's answer phase reads those, so the front of
the program moves on: a call deferred once is answered before the next round runs.

A round that ends with `ok` on either service is the last round. A round that defers a
call that was deferred before — the program did not move — and the round cap both end
the schedule with a failure, so a schedule that cannot finish is reported instead of
looping.

The scheduler holds no program and no api of its own: the program comes from
`--program`, and each `--service NAME=MODULE` names a module whose `__main__` runs
`distributed.service.run_service` with that service's api. `demo/distributed/naive/`
(two services), `demo/distributed/delivery/` (three) and `demo/distributed/reading/`
(five, one operation each) are three such sets of modules.

    python3 -m distributed.scheduler --store <directory> --program <file> \\
        --service <name>=<module> --service <name>=<module>

It prints one JSON line per round and one line for the outcome; the exit code is 0 for
a schedule that reached `ok`.
