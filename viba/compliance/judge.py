"""Running a rule: compliance is what the program answers.

A rule is a viba program — `environ` in, a verdict out. Running it *is* the
judgment, so there is no judgment layer here: `is_compliant` runs the file and
reads the `bool` it answered.

What a rule cannot do by itself is the impure part: a measurement reads a clock,
a service, a die. That goes through `measure`, which is where the *Prepare*
lives:

    value = measure(environ, "distance", call, compute)

- the call it measures is a Prepare — the arguments fixed, the result declared —
  kept as a file in the storage (`viba/compliance/storage.py`);
- a Prepare that already carries a measured value is **replayed**: `compute` is
  not called at all;
- one that does not is measured now, and the value is written into this run's
  store, where the next run finds it.

`prepare_run` is the other direction: run a rule and *record* the Prepares it
measured into the backup, which is how a case comes to be prepared once and
judged as often as wanted.
