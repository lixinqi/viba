"""The store a rule runs against: its own writes, and the Prepare backup.

A *Prepare* is the call a measurement was made of — the arguments fixed, the
result declared — kept as a file in the store. The one a run is handed was
backed up before it started (that is what makes the run repeatable); so:

- reading `prepare/...` looks at what this run wrote first, and at the backup
  second — a run replays the evidence it was given, and can still write its own;
- writing `prepare/...` goes into this run's store and never into the backup:
  the backup is the evidence, and a run does not get to rewrite it.

Recording a backup is a separate, deliberate act: `record_text` (see
`viba.compliance.judge.prepare_run`).
