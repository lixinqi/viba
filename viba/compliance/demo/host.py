"""The demo's host side: what the witness' and the rule's functions actually do.

`DistanceHost` is the `get_func` of a run of `rule_distance.viba` — the case of
the victim at (0,0) and the suspect at (3,4) at 12:30. It records what it was
asked, which is how a test tells a replayed run from a measured one:

- `witnessed` gets one entry per witness asked for — the facts of the case come
  through the host, not written into the witness file;
- `measured` gets one entry per *measurement actually taken* — a run that
  replayed its Prepare leaves it empty;
- `judged` gets one entry per verdict asked for, which every run does.
