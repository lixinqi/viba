"""Service A of the naive distributed demo: two api, and the process that serves them.

Both api are leaves with one int in and one int out, and both are impure: the
amount they add (or multiply by) is drawn in this process, at this moment. What
makes the program reproducible is `Service.recorded` — the drawn amount is written
into the store with the result, so every later run, in this process or in the
other, replays that result instead of drawing again.

The scheduler starts this process; by hand it is:

    python3 -m demo.distributed.naive.service_a --store <dir> --phase run \
        --program demo/distributed/naive/interleaved.viba
